# Investigation of Saudi Arabia COVID-19 Cases (Mar 2020 - Oct 2021)
Sara Alfaraj | 3 Oct 2021

## Abstract
The goal of this project was to investigate COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia. A key aspect of this study is to display the most common factors that lead to an increased COVID-19 number of cases, in addition, predict the number of cases on a certain date.  First, I collect the data from The King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center. Then, apply feature engineering along with a random forest model to get the results.    

## Design
This project discusses the questions below:
- Are the different seasons and events (Summer, Winter, holidays, Eids...) affect the number of COVID-19 cases?
- Do the numbers of COVID-19 cases differ between big/main cities and small cities?
- What is the expected date of reaching zero cases? 
- Is the COVID-19 cases indicators expected to rise again after returning to school ( at 31 Oct 2021)?

## Data
- **The main data in this study obtained from The King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center [KAPSARC data portal](https://datasource.kapsarc.org/explore/dataset/saudi-arabia-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-situation/export/?disjunctive.daily_cumulative&disjunctive.indicator&disjunctive.event&disjunctive.city_en&disjunctive.region_en), which gathered by [Ministr of Helth in Saudi Arabia](https://covid19.moh.gov.sa/).**
  - Include these fetures:
    - Number of Cases (Daily / Cumulative)
    - Case Indicators (Active, Mortalities, Critical ...)
    - Number of Cases 
    - Date
    - Events
    - City
    - Region
    - Day

  - Consists of 428346 rowØŒ related to 207 cities in Saudi Arabia.
  - Unit of measure: Persons.
  - Range of the dates: 1 Mar 2020 to 1 Oct 2021.

## Algorithms

*Feature Engineering*
1. Converting categorical features to binary dummy variables
2. Selecting subsets of categorical features 
3. Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
4. During EDA; DataType converting, feature adding.


*Models*
- Logistic regression and random forest classifiers. 
- The training dataset records was split into 80% for train and 20% for test.

**Final Model Scores:** 
   - Accuracy:
   - F1:
   - precision:
   - recall:

## Tools
- `Numpy` and `Pandas` for data manipulation
- `sklearn` for modeling
- `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for plotting


## Communication
Presentation slide, that have visuals and discussions
