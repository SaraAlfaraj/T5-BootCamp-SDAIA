# T5-BootCamp-SDAIA
This project is part of T5 data Analysis BootCamp, Sept-Oct 2021.
The goal of this project was to investigate COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia. A key aspect of this study is to display the most common factors that lead to an increased COVID-19 number of cases, in addition, predict the number of cases on a certain date. First, I collect the data from The King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center. Then, apply feature engineering along with a random forest model to get the results.
